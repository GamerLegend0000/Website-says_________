# Websites-that-talk
Want a website to say what you want? Well this is an entire library of codes for you
This is not a code so don't copy and paste
I create these codes and then you can book mark them to try them out
If you don't know how to use my codes here is how:

1. Copy the code you want to use (CTRL+C)
2. You open up a new tab
3. Bookmark the new tab and make sure the bookmark is on your taskbar and not in a file on your taskbar
4. Then you rightn click on the new tab bookmark you made and click "edit"
5. After you will see a window or weird thing pop up and a box with words like folder and page, If you see this you are doing the right thing
6. Next you go to the box that says "URL" near it and paste the code in and click save
7. Once your done with clicking save you can go to any website and click the bookmark and the website will be forced to say something.

Hope these instructions helped you and email our business if it doesn't: thegaminglegend0000@gmail.com.
